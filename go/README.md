# Go

* Use the built-in [encoding/json] package to manipulate JSON.
* See [nato.go](./nato.go) for an implementation of the JSON handling
  described in the [JSON Primer].
* See the [Go blog] for more on using `interface{}` for generic JSON.
* Use [net/http] for HTTP.

To run this code:

```bash
go run nato.go
```
