Visit
https://stripe-bikemap.appspot.com/map.png?center=47.6,-122.3&zoom=9&size=800x500
in your browser
to see staticmap in action.

(`staticmap` is adapted from [github.com/Luzifer/staticmap].)

## Rendering a Map from JSON data

It's tedious to specify complex parameters in a querystring.
We can send a **JSON request body** to `staticmap` instead.

Use [staticmap_example.json] as an example of the data that you will need to
send as an HTTP `POST` request to
`https://stripe-bikemap.appspot.com/map.png`

The [staticmap_example.json] file contains:

* **Parameters**, such as `center`, `width`, `height`, and `zoom`,
  that define a map of Seattle.
* **Markers**
  * a blue, labeled marker for the Chief Sealth Trail
  * a marker (which defaults to red) at Mount Baker station
  * a yellow marker on Jefferson Park
* **Paths**
  * a purple path along Beacon Avenue
  * a red path for part of the Chief Sealth Trail

### POSTing a request with curl

Let's use the [curl] command-line HTTP client to
send a request to `staticmap`.

Using Curl's descriptive option names:

* `--request POST`: send the `POST` HTTP verb.
* `--data-binary "@staticmap_example.json"`:
  read the *contents* of the file `staticmap_example.json`
  and use that data as the request's body.
* `--output example.png`: save the response body
  to the file `example.png`.

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --data-binary "@staticmap_example.json" \
     https://stripe-bikemap.appspot.com/map.png \
     --output example.png
```

Be sure to sure to run `curl` from the directory where `staticmap_example.json` is located
(the root of this repo).

If you're using [PowerShell Core] on Windows (or Mac or Linux):

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -uri https://stripe-bikemap.appspot.com/map.png -Method Post -Infile staticmap_example.json -outfile example.png
```

### Opening an Image Manually

You can open `example.png` in a web browser
or some other image previewer.

If you like,
you can use the following invocations
from the *command-line*
to open `example.png`:

* MacOS:
  * `open example.png` will open the image in the default image viewer
  * `open -a Preview example.png` opens the image in Preview
* Windows (cmd.exe):
  * `start example.png`
* Windows (PowerShell):
  * `Invoke-Item example.png`
* Linux:
  * `xdg-open example.png`
